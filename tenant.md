Well the rent's too high and the wages low
(Leave her, Johnny, leave her!)
Ne’er thought that I would leave ‘Frisco 
(But it's time for us to leave her!) 

The landlord said we cannot stay
(Leave her, Johnny, leave her!)
O where we'll go I cannot say
(And it's time for us to leave her!)

{Chorus}
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
O leave her, Johnny, leave her
For the land’s not mine and the rent’s too high
And it's time for us to leave her!

So we packed our things in the beat up truck
(Leave her, Johnny, leave her!)
In old Texas we’ll try our luck
(And it's time for us to leave her!)

We soon set foot in Austin town
(Leave her Johnny leave her)
Still the rents they rise and won't come down
(And it's time for us to leave her!)
 
{Chorus}
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
O leave her, Johnny, leave her
For the land’s not mine and the rent’s too high
And it's time for us to leave her!

We’re moving on yet once again
(Leave her Johnny leave her)
What is the force that drives our pain?
(And it’s time for us to leave her!)
 
The ghost of Henry George replied
(Leave her Johnny leave her)
Land Value Tax would turn the tide
(And it's time for us to leave her!)

Alternate final verse:
By Henry George, something’s amiss
(Leave her Johnny leave her)
Land Value Tax would solve this
(And it's time for us to leave her!)
 
{Chorus}
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
O leave her, Johnny, leave her
For the land’s not mine and the rent’s too high
And it's time for us to leave her!
