**Young man**, we are building a town  
I said, **young man**, welcome home come on down  
I said, **young man**, join us as we work hard  
You are Welcome In Our Back Yard  

**Young man**, are you feeling alone?  
C’mon, **young man**, let’s abolish the zones!  
We’ll build **right here**, dense mixed use all the time  
Right next to the main transit line!  

  {Chorus}
   *It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.*  
   *It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.*  

   *They build everything for all of the townsfolk*  
   *You can live there and not go broke*  

   *It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.*  
   *It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.*  

   *You can get a good job, and not pay so much rent,*  
   *While the NIMBYs can all get bent!*  

**Young man**, go ahead grab your bike  
I said, **young man**, let the cars take a hike  
I said, **young man**, we’ll be free from the schemes  
Of the high cost of free parking  

**No one** has the right to say no  
And tell **young folks** where they can and can't go  
So just **come here**, and the Y. IM. B. Y’s  
Will fight for homes by your side!  

  {Chorus}  
  *It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.*  
  *It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.*  
  
  *They build everything for all of the townsfolk*  
  *You can live there and not go broke*  
  
  *It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.*  
  *It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.*  

  *You can get a good job, and not pay so much rent,*  
  *While the NIMBYs can all get bent!*  

**Young man**, I was once in your place  
I said **I was** down and out on my face  
Let’s fight **THOSE WHO** think that houses are crimes  
And erase these AR-BI-TRA-RY lines  

**Hey y’all**, we’re still right at the start  
So come **on ’all**, let’s all join and take part  
With **the Georgists** right along hand in hand  
We’ll build homes and we’ll tax the land!  

It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.  
It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.  

They build everything for all of the townsfolk  
You can live there and not go broke  
  
Y. IM. B. Y.  
It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.  

Young man, young man, we are building a town  
Young man, welcome home come on down.  

Y. IM. B. Y.  
It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.  

Young man, go ahead grab your bike  
I said, young man, let the cars take a hike  

Y. IM. B. Y.  
It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.  

No one, no one, has the right to say no  
And tell all young folks where they can and can’t go  

Y. IM. B. Y.  
And just build with the Y. IM. B. Y.  

Young man, young man, I was once in your place  
Young man, young man, I was down and out on my face  

Y. IM. B. Y.  
It’s fun to build with the Y. IM. B. Y.
